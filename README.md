📦 NFTMarketplace_StakingMerged
A full-stack decentralized NFT Marketplace with advanced features such as token staking, zkDrop-based airdrop eligibility, royalty-based resale tracking, and a DeFi-integrated reward model.

🚀 Features
🖼️ NFT Minting

Mint NFTs with metadata (URI, name, price) gated by zkDrop airdrop eligibility.

Royalty distribution on every resale to the original minter.

💰 Token Staking

Stake custom ERC20 tokens to earn real-time staking rewards.

Tiered access (e.g., premium minters post NFTs freely if staked enough).

🪂 zkDrop Gated Airdrops

Minting restricted to users who’ve proven zkDrop eligibility via zero-knowledge proof (ZKP).

Uses Merkle Tree + zk-SNARKs to verify without exposing wallet data.

🧠 Smart Contract Integration

NFTandDefiMerged.sol: Central logic for minting, resale, and staking checks.

Staking.sol: Handles ERC20 staking, reward tracking, and claiming.

PrivateAirdrop.sol: Verifies zkDrop airdrop claims.

ERC20Token.sol: Custom ERC20 token used for staking and ERTN-based purchases.
